# AutHotkey Windows Key Remappings

Custom key remappings for Windows created with [AutoHotkey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Goal

The goal of these remappings is making a Windows keyboard more similar to a Mac keyboard.

## Installation

1. Install AutoHotkey v2.0 from the [official website](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
1. Open the Run dialog box with _Win-R_ and type `shell:startup`
   - This opens the startup folder whose content is executed automatically on startup
1. Place a copy of [`autohotkey.ahk`] in the opened folder
1. Sign out and sign in again

Now the AutoHotkey remappings should always be applied automatically at startup. An icon in the notification area of the taskbar indicates that AutoHotkey is running:
